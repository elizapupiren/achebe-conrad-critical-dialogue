# Digital Critical Edition: Achebe vs. Conrad

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a collaborative digital critical edition of scholarly responses to Chinua Achebe's seminal essay, **"An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*."** The project aims to deepen our collective understanding of the central debate surrounding colonialism, racism, and the representation of Africa in literature.

### Core Texts

- **Joseph Conrad**, *Heart of Darkness* (1899)
- **Chinua Achebe**, "An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*" (1975)

### Purpose

By curating analyses of key scholarly articles that engage with, support, or challenge Achebe's critique, we build a living resource that illustrates the ongoing dialogue between postcolonial theory, literary criticism, and canonical Western literature. This digital edition simulates the academic processes of submission, peer review, and publication, providing graduate students with hands‑on experience in digital humanities workflows.

## How to Contribute

1. **Select a scholarly article or book chapter** that directly responds to Achebe’s arguments.
2. **Create a new branch** named `contribution/author-name-article-title`.
3. **Write your analysis** in a Markdown file placed in the `contributions/` folder (see the `contributions/` directory for examples).
4. **Submit a Pull Request** titled “Analysis: [Author Name]’s Response to Achebe.”
5. **Respond to peer‑review feedback** and, once approved, your work will be merged into the main edition.

## Repository Structure

- `contributions/` – Contains individual analyses (one Markdown file per article)
- `README.md` – This project description
- `LICENSE` – The project’s open‑source license (if applicable)
- Additional resources may be added as the edition grows.

## Acknowledgments

This project is designed for a graduate‑level seminar on African literature, postcolonial theory, and digital humanities. It is inspired by the collaborative, open‑source ethos of the GitHub platform and the rigorous scholarly traditions of literary criticism.
